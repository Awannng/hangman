## General info
This program is Hangman game that randomly select a word from three categories of movie, fruit, and sport. There is given hint and 12 attempts and 5 misses to guess the word. I created this project because it's my first time using Python to created a program from scratch. By creating this project, I get more familiarize with the function, the random package and have more experience on how to code in Python.
