## General info
This program is a Hangman game that randomly selects a word from three categories of movie, fruit, and sport. There is a hint and 12 attempts and 5 misses to guess the word. I created this project because it's my first time using Python to create a program from scratch. By creating this project, I get more familiar with the function, the random package and have more experience on how to code in Python.
